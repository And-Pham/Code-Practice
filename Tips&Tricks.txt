C++

- The & operator returns the address value of the variable
- The * operator returns the value for a given pointer

- The . operator accesses the members of an object given the object
- The -> operator accesses the members of an object given a pointer

- Stringstream object can be used to treat strings as I/O from the cmd line
	- ex. You can use the << or >> operators

- There are Python-esque for loops
	- ex. for (char s : S) where S is a string
