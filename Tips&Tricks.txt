C++

- The & operator returns the address value of the variable
- The * operator returns the value for a given pointer

- The . operator accesses the members of an object given the object
- The -> operator accesses the members of an object given a pointer

- Stringstream object can be used to treat strings as I/O from the cmd line
	- ex. You can use the << or >> operators

- There are Python-esque For loops
	- ex. for (char s : S) where S is a string

- Bitwise operators works on plain integers
	- ex.
		a = 5, b = 9 	// a = 5(00000101), b = 9(00001001) 
		a&b = 1 		// AND
		a|b = 13 		// OR
		a^b = 12		// XOR
		~a = 250		// NOT
		b<<1 = 18		// LEFT SHIFT
		b>>1 = 4		// RIGHT SHIFT

- To pause a program, you can wait for a user input with cin.get()
